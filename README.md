# Password-Generator-HW
In this activity we used java script to run a password generator. We created variables and applied functions to randomize letters, numbers, and symbols for a password. 

Users can choose between 8 and 128 characters for their password, they can choose whether or not their password will include Uppercase letters, Lowercase letters, Numbers or Special Symbols.
